When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Because it's way harder to share local files with other people, especially if they're far away. Local copies are also prone to breaking (hardware failure), and it's possible that a virus or other malicious software might delete or modify some crucial files. Keeping it in a remote repository allows other users to simply clone the repo to get the newest version of said files, and allows modifying them with ease. It's also safer because no one malicious can get to those files.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because I might want to operate on older version that worked better/had different functionality than the newest version on the branch, and then create a different branch based on this old commit.
If it was done automatically, it might ruin my program, because newest version might use different code than the older version. That's why I want to pull changes by hand.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are used when you want to use somebody else's project from their repository and create a modified version of it that you want to use or share, either for yourself, or for the original creator to consider adding these features to.
Clone is used to download the whole repository (either yours or not) to your PC for local use and modification.
Branches are used if you want to test or add some new experimental features in the master branch of the programs without destroying or modifying the master branch code - you just branch off of it and work alongside it in your own branch.
